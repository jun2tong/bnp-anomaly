# **TREDMAD**: Temporally-REweighted Dirichlet Process Mixture Anomaly Detector

Development of TREDMAD is forked off from [**bnpy**](https://github.com/bnpy/bnpy). 

Nick and Jun did this as a class project at University of Waterloo, and they decided to spin their work into a workshop paper at ICDM 2020.


## Workshop paper

This work is accepted into Large-Scale Industrial Time-Series Analysis (LITSA) workshop at ICDM 2020.

## TODO

- Include IEEE paper link, when finally published.
